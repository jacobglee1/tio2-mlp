Scripts for running each different simulation discussed in the paper are provided in the following directories:  
  
MLP data and training logs:               mlp-data  
Geomtry Optimation at T = 0 (iterative):	geom-opt-T-0  
NPT MD at T = T_0 and T = T_1: 	  		    npt-md  
Geometry Optimisation at T = T_0: 		    geom-opt-T-100  
i-PI Phonons and NVT MD at T = T_0:		    ipi-phonons-and-nvt  
Gibbs Free Energy and TI Calculations:		ti  
Anatase Compression MD: 	  		          anatase-compression  
  
RuNNer was used for training the MLP.  
LAMMPS, incluing the N2P2 plugin, and i-PI were used for the subsequent simulations.
